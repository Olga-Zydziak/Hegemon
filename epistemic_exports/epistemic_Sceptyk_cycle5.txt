CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Reasoning
   Building a production-quality Data Platform with streaming, validation, and versioning in 4 weeks, and deploying Kubeflow and Seldon Core in 6-8 weeks, assumes zero integration problems and a team with immediate, in-depth expertise in at least seven complex technologies.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   The proposed implementation plan has critical flaws that threaten its success.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   The proposal creates an illusion of full autonomy, ignoring key points of coupling.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   The feature store, described as a "shared kernel", actually becomes a central point of failure and an organizational bottleneck.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The schedule is unrealistically short.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Stable deployment of Kubeflow in an organization can take a whole quarter.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Such time pressure guarantees the creation of technical debt, not solid foundations.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Changes in the feature store, even with API versioning, will require coordination of all three "autonomous" teams, negating the idea of independent work.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The feedback loop (serving -> data) is much more complex than a simple contract and often requires dedicated logic, blurring boundaries.
