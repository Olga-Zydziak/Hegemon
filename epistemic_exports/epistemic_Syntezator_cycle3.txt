1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The mission is to deploy a risk-mitigated three-phase AI customer service system over 6 months.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Phase 1 (Foundation & pilot) will occur in months 1-3.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Phase 2 (Hybrid AI-human model) will occur in months 3-5.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Phase 3 (Scaled deployment with continuous optimization) will occur in months 5-6.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The budget includes 15% contingency for unforeseen integration challenges.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   The project targets a 28% cost reduction and 5-8 point CSAT improvement.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   The existing knowledge base requires 3-4 weeks of cleaning.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   A key risk is data readiness delay with a 40% probability.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   A mitigation for data readiness delay is to start the data audit immediately and allocate $50K contingency for external data contractors.

10. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   There is a 30% probability of a CSAT drop during the transition.

11. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   A mitigation for CSAT drop is to maintain 100% human fallback for the first 8 weeks and implement one-click escalation.

12. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   There is a 25% probability of integration complexity with legacy systems.

13. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   A mitigation for integration complexity is to build an API abstraction layer and conduct a security audit in week 1.

14. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   There is a 35% probability of agent resistance to role change.

15. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The strategy integrates Thesis ambition (full automation potential) with Antithesis caution (data readiness, integration complexity).
