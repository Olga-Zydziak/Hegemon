CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The integration is framed as an $80,000 cost *elimination*, but fails to account for the substantial and recurring licensing and maintenance costs of a platform like Salesforce Einstein, which can easily exceed this figure.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Achieving a 40% cost reduction and a 15-point CSAT increase simultaneously within six months is a high-risk gamble.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The predictive service is not an off-the-shelf feature; it’s a complex data science project that requires significant investment in data cleaning, model development, and validation, which appears underfunded.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The cost of recruiting and training replacements for agents who are unwilling or unable to adapt to these new, more complex roles is an unbudgeted expense.

5. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   A rushed deployment is likely to result in a poorly trained AI and a flawed escalation process, creating customer frustration that tanks satisfaction scores.

6. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The budget of $500,000 seems insufficient for a custom three-tier AI system, especially one requiring deep Salesforce integration and a predictive machine learning model (Tier 3).

7. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   Redeploying nearly 50% of the customer service team risks significant employee churn and morale collapse.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Assuming these redeployed agents can immediately become a revenue-generating outreach team without extensive, specialized training is a leap of faith.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Focusing exclusively on perfecting Tiers 1 and 2 within the initial six-month timeframe would allow the team to stabilize the core automation and agent-assist tools, prove the ROI on a smaller scale, and manage the organizational change more carefully before attempting the highly speculative predictive service of Tier 3.
