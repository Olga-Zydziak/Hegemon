CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Stage 1 (months 0-3) focuses on a simple orchestrator (Airflow or Prefect), standard model registry (MLflow) and basic monitoring.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The budget for Stage 1 is 2 engineers for a quarter.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Each stage has a clear "go/no-go" checkpoint based on adoption metrics and business value.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The ML pipeline should be defined as a three-stage maturity system, where each level delivers measurable business value before moving to the next.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   The success metric for Stage 1 is 3 models in production with automatic retraining.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   Stage 2 (months 4-9) introduces a feature store only for documented cases of feature reuse above 40%.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   Stage 3 (months 10-18) involves full orchestration with automated retraining, A/B testing infrastructure, and advanced monitoring, only if 10+ models are in production and ROI of previous stages is documented.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The first iteration's fundamental mistake was assuming simultaneous implementation of all components.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Success of ML infrastructure is measured by idea-to-production time and model maintenance cost, not by architectural sophistication.

10. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The goal of Stage 1 is to reduce deployment time from weeks to 48 hours for simple models.

11. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Facts
   The success metric for Stage 2 is 5 teams using shared features and a 30% compute cost reduction.

12. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Each stage is self-sufficient and delivers ROI independently of subsequent phases.

13. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The goal of Stage 2 is to reduce feature engineering time by 60% for repetitive cases.

14. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Heuristics
   Stage 1 eliminates 80% of organizational pain with 20% of the complexity of the full solution.

15. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Reasoning
   Expected results after 18 months include idea-to-production time below 1 week, 15+ models in production, 50% reduction in ML infrastructure maintenance costs, and 3x increase in data scientist productivity.
