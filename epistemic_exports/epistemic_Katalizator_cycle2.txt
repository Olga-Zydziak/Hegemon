CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Phase one deploys an AI-powered intent classification and routing system integrated directly into Salesforce.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Phase one requires eight weeks and $180,000.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Phase two introduces an AI co-pilot system for human agents, providing real-time response suggestions, automatic case summarization, and proactive escalation recommendations, deployed over weeks nine through sixteen with $200,000 investment.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The final phase implements predictive issue prevention, using machine learning to identify customers likely to experience problems and proactively addressing them before tickets are generated, consuming the remaining $120,000 and final eight weeks.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   The strategy centers on implementing a progressive three-phase approach over six months.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   Phase one will process all incoming inquiries and automatically resolve the straightforward 45% comprising order status, shipping updates, and basic product information queries.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Successful AI automation in customer service requires abandoning the false choice between cost reduction and satisfaction improvement.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The critical leverage point lies in deploying AI to eliminate the cognitive burden of repetitive pattern recognition while preserving human judgment for nuanced situations.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The phased approach allows continuous refinement based on real performance data rather than theoretical projections.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   We should architect a phased intelligence amplification system that treats AI as a capability multiplier for human agents rather than a replacement mechanism.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The Salesforce integration ensures seamless deployment without workflow disruption.

12. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   By month six, we project handling 45% of inquiries through full automation and accelerating human agent resolution time by 35% through AI assistance, yielding a combined 32% cost reduction while maintaining current staffing levels for complex cases.

13. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Reasoning
   Customer satisfaction scores should increase by 8-12 points through faster response times and reduced wait periods.
