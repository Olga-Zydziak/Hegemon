1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The proposed architecture is based on three independent bounded contexts: Data Platform, Model Platform, and Serving Platform.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The real challenge in designing an ML pipeline lies in defining the boundaries of responsibility and contracts between components, not in choosing between a monolith and microservices.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Each context operates as an autonomous system with its own SLAs but communicates through explicitly defined contracts: data contracts, model contracts, and serving contracts.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Contract testing should be introduced from day one, requiring backward compatibility for every contract change for a minimum of 2 release cycles.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Model approval workflow should include automatic gates for bias detection, performance thresholds, and infrastructure cost estimation.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The feature store's API is treated as a public contract with semantic versioning.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This approach allows different teams to work independently while maintaining the consistency of the entire system.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   A governance layer should be implemented as automated compliance, not bureaucracy.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Data Platform, including streaming ingestion, schema validation, and versioning, can be built in the first 4 weeks.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Model Platform, including MLflow, Kubeflow, and DVC, can be ready in 6 weeks.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Serving Platform, utilizing Seldon Core or KServe and Prometheus/Grafana, can be operational in 8 weeks.

12. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Success is measured by time-to-production of the first model below 3 weeks from a ready Data Platform.

13. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Success is also measured by an average deployment time of subsequent models below 2 days.

14. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Success is measured by zero production incidents related to contract violations in the first 6 months.
