CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   Phase one's goal of automating 40% of inquiries in two months presupposes a clean, structured, and AI-ready knowledge base.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The leap in Phase three to handling complex transactional tasks like refunds and account modifications is a monumental jump in technical complexity, not a simple scaling exercise.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The phased approach rests on overly optimistic assumptions regarding timeline, cost, and human factors.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The plan's aggressive six-month timeline significantly underestimates the upfront effort required for data readiness.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   These actions require deep, robust API integrations with backend financial and order management systems, which are notoriously brittle and expensive to build.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The thesis overlooks critical ongoing operational costs for maintaining and updating the AI models and knowledge base.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The $480K annual savings figure is a gross, not net, calculation.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Creating and curating this content from disparate sources is a multi-month project in itself.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The allocated $150K for this phase is insufficient for the level of systems integration and security testing required.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Early-stage AI often creates customer frustration through misunderstood intent and "containment traps" where users cannot reach a human.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The transition of agents to "AI supervisors" requires extensive change management and retraining, during which productivity and morale may temporarily dip.

12. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   A more prudent strategy would involve a pilot program targeting a single, high-volume query type across all three phases.

13. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   The projected CSAT increase of 6-10 points is also questionable.

14. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   A poorly executed initial phase could easily lead to a *decrease* in CSAT, jeopardizing the entire program.
