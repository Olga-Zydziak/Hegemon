1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This figure fails to account for the "long tail" of nuance in seemingly simple queries (e.g., split shipments, damaged packaging).

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The phased, intelligence-amplification model is conceptually sound.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   These assumptions introduce significant risk to the budget, timeline, and customer satisfaction goals.

4. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   The implementation plan rests on several overly optimistic assumptions.

5. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   The projection that 45% of inquiries can be fully automated within eight weeks is particularly precarious.
