CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The Thesis presents an ambitious three-tier AI automation strategy with specific metrics (40% cost reduction, 15-point CSAT improvement) and detailed implementation phases.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The consensus score is 0.52.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Antithesis provides rigorous critique focusing on three critical vulnerabilities: unrealistic timeline expectations, insufficient budget allocation (particularly for Einstein licensing and Tier 3 predictive analytics), and underestimated human capital risks in redeploying 50% of the customer service team.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   They diverge significantly on execution feasibility, financial realism, and risk assessment.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Both sides agree on the conceptual soundness of the tiered architecture, indicating partial convergence on the strategic framework.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Antithesis proposes a de-risked alternative focusing on Tiers 1-2 only, which represents a constructive counter-proposal rather than pure opposition.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Both parties accept the tiered architecture concept and identify similar problem domains, but differ fundamentally on scope and timeline.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Arguments are evidence-based with specific numbers, though the Thesis lacks detailed cost breakdowns that the Antithesis rightfully challenges.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Critical gaps remain around Einstein licensing costs, change management specifics, and fallback strategies if pilots fail.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   One more debate round would significantly benefit the plan by forcing reconciliation of the budget reality check and timeline concerns.
