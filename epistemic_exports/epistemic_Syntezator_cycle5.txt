CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The first step is to identify and document a high-ROI use case with clear business metrics (e.g., churn prediction saving $100k/month).

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Phase 1 (Q1) will deploy a single high-ROI model with minimal infrastructure (Airflow, MLflow, FastAPI).

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The ML Platform Architect will design the overall pipeline architecture, define bounded contexts and API contracts, and ensure scalability without overengineering.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The Data Engineering Lead will build data ingestion pipelines, implement schema validation with Great Expectations, and manage feature store adoption.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The MLOps Engineer will implement model deployment infrastructure, set up monitoring and alerting, and manage retraining orchestration.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The Model Validation Specialist will establish a model governance framework, implement bias detection, and monitor data drift and model performance degradation.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The Infrastructure DevOps Engineer will manage cloud resources, optimize compute costs, ensure system reliability and implement disaster recovery.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   A minimal viable infrastructure will be set up using Airflow for orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking, and basic Git-based versioning.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Models will be deployed via FastAPI with Prometheus monitoring, establishing baseline metrics and alerting thresholds.

10. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The model validation framework will include bias detection, performance thresholds (min 5% improvement), and drift monitoring (15% PSI limit).

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Phase 2 (Q2-Q3) will extract reusable patterns and introduce a selective feature store for proven reuse cases.

12. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Phase 3 (Q4) will establish a bounded contexts architecture with explicit contracts only after validating 5+ models in production.

13. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The ETL pipeline for the first use case will include schema validation using Great Expectations, targeting 95% data quality.

14. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   A lightweight feature store (Feast or Redis-based) will be implemented only for features with >40% reuse across models.

15. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Reasoning
   The expected outcome is a 70% reduction in deployment time and 15+ models by year-end.
