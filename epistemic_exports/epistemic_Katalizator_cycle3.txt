1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   Phase one (months 1-2, $150K) establishes the foundation: deploy a Salesforce-native AI assistant that handles the 40% of inquiries requiring only information retrieval.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   Phase two (months 3-4, $200K) introduces intelligent routing and agent augmentation.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   Phase three (months 5-6, $150K) scales the system and optimizes performance.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The company's constraints—limited budget, tight timeline, existing Salesforce infrastructure—define an optimal path: progressive automation through intelligent triage rather than wholesale replacement.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Simultaneously, conversation analytics will be implemented on all customer interactions to build a training dataset and identify the next automation opportunities.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   This hybrid model targets the 35% of interactions that benefit from human judgment but waste time on information gathering.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The phased implementation mitigates technical risk, allows for learning and adjustment, and builds internal confidence in AI capabilities.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This uses existing Einstein capabilities enhanced with custom knowledge base integration, requiring minimal technical risk.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The AI system will triage incoming requests, automatically resolving simple cases while routing complex issues to human agents with full context and suggested responses.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   AI capabilities will be expanded to handle the long tail of repetitive complex queries—refund processing, basic troubleshooting, account modifications—while continuously refining models based on accumulated interaction data.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   A three-phase system should be implemented over six months to systematically capture efficiency gains while building organizational capability.

12. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   It positions the company for continued automation gains beyond the initial six months as models improve with accumulated data.

13. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Heuristics
   Expected outcome of phase one: 15% cost reduction from volume deflection, baseline CSAT maintenance.

14. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Heuristics
   Expected outcome of phase two: additional 12% cost reduction from improved agent productivity, 5-8 point CSAT improvement from faster, more consistent responses.

15. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Heuristics
   This approach delivers 32% total cost reduction ($480K annual savings) while improving CSAT by 6-10 points through faster resolution and 24/7 availability.
