1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The first layer, Reproducibility & Observability Foundation, involves implementing MLflow for experiment tracking and Prometheus with Grafana for inference monitoring within two months.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This layer involves implementing Airflow for orchestration and a lightweight feature store for 10-15 frequently used features.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This layer includes AutoML for hyperparameter optimization, A/B testing framework, and dynamic resource allocation.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The proposed approach is based on three horizontal capability layers, each delivering business value within 8-12 weeks.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This system supports the first 3-5 models with full reproducibility and alerts on data drift above 15% PSI.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The second layer, Automated Retraining & Feature Consistency, is built in parallel for models from the first layer that have achieved production stability.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Only models with a proven ROI (>$50k annual savings or >20% improvement in a key metric) are migrated to the second layer.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The third layer, Adaptive Intelligence & Auto-scaling, is activated when there are at least 8-10 models in production with stabilized workflows.

9. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Each layer is production-ready and generates ROI independently of subsequent layers.

10. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   If the organization stops after the second layer, it still has a working, valuable system.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   The cost of the first layer is estimated at 1.5 FTE for 8 weeks and infrastructure costs of ~$500/month.

12. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Heuristics
   The first layer is expected to reduce debugging time by 60% and eliminate the "works on my machine" syndrome.

13. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Heuristics
   The timeline for the second layer is 10-12 weeks with 2 FTE, resulting in a 40% reduction in training time and elimination of training-serving skew.

14. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Heuristics
   The third layer reduces time-to-production for new models from 3 months to 3 weeks.
