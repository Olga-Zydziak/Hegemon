CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   Both parties converge on phased implementation, intelligence amplification over replacement, Salesforce-native deployment, and the three-tier architecture.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The Thesis has progressively refined its proposal, moderating cost reduction claims from 40% to 32%, adjusting CSAT projections from 15 points to 6-10 points, and providing increasingly granular budget allocations ($150K/$200K/$150K).

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Facts
   The Antithesis has evolved from broad feasibility concerns to laser-focused critiques on specific execution risks: data readiness timelines, knowledge base curation effort, API integration complexity for transactional automation, change management costs, and the "containment trap" phenomenon in early-stage AI deployments.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   Both parties now share a common understanding of the problem space and solution architecture.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   Convergence (0.80) - both parties agree on phased approach, Salesforce integration, hybrid AI-human model, and the need for progressive capability building, with remaining disagreements limited to specific timeline feasibility and budget sufficiency

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.75 | Basis: Reasoning
   Quality (0.75) - arguments are evidence-based with concrete numbers, the Thesis provides detailed phase breakdowns, and the Antithesis offers sophisticated critiques on data readiness, API integration complexity, and change management costs

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Disagreements narrowing to execution parameters, risk assessment, and timeline realism rather than fundamental strategy.

8. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Readiness (0.70) - sufficient material exists for coherent synthesis that acknowledges both the strategic framework and critical risk mitigation requirements

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.65 | Basis: Reasoning
   Completeness (0.65) - major strategic elements are well-defined, though implementation details around change management, pilot program structure, and ongoing operational costs need clarification

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   The debate has reached a productive equilibrium where core strategy is aligned and remaining concerns can be addressed through synthesis rather than additional debate cycles.
