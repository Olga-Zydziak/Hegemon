1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   A modern ML pipeline should be treated as a living evolutionary system that grows with the organization.

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   A feature store should be implemented as a single source of truth for all data transformations, eliminating training-serving skew and enabling feature reuse between teams.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   An ML metadata store (MLflow or Weights & Biases) should be integrated at the level of each experiment, automatically tracking hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Investing in templates, documentation, and self-service tooling is required for the 'platform team of one' model.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Success is measured by the time from idea to a working A/B test in production, not the number of deployed models.

6. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The key insight is shifting the paradigm from 'building a pipeline' to 'designing a machine learning ecosystem' that naturally scales from prototype to production without rewriting code.

7. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   ML metadata store integration reduces debugging time by 40-60% according to industry benchmarks.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Orchestration should be based on Airflow or Prefect with declarative DAGs, where each model has an automatically generated pipeline from training through validation to deployment.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Feast or Tecton should be implemented with the ability to handle both batch and streaming features, with a target of 95% coverage of use cases in the first 6 months.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Adopting a 'platform team of one' model is a strategic move, creating abstractions that allow a data scientist to independently release a model to production in 2-3 days instead of 6-8 weeks.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   Within 12 months, a culture of experimentation where the cost of failure is low is expected.

12. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Heuristics
   ROI for the 'platform team of one' model appears after the third deployed model.

13. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.40 | Basis: Reasoning
   Within 12 months, a 70% reduction in time-to-production is expected.

14. [LOW]  Confidence: 0.30 | Basis: Speculation
   Within 12 months, a 3-4x increase in the number of experiments is expected due to reduced friction.
