CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   The key question is not "how to build a complete pipeline" but "how to deliver value as quickly as possible while maintaining the ability to evolve."

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Start with a single predictive model with a clearly defined ROI, such as conversion optimization or churn prediction.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Instead of building a platform and then looking for applications, build around a specific, high-value use case that becomes a prototype for all future implementations.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   This is a production system handling real traffic, generating measurable results from day one.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Each component is built as a template with clearly defined extension points.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   When a second use case appears, the template is duplicated and only what is necessary is modified.

7. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Implement a minimalist pipeline consisting of a simple ETL in Apache Airflow (or even cron + Python), model versioning in MLflow, and deployment via FastAPI with basic monitoring in Prometheus within the first 6 weeks.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Domain_Knowledge
   Each model must generate measurable business value within 30 days of deployment.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Heuristics
   Infrastructure scales organically - feature store is added only when the third model requires shared features, orchestration when there are 5+ daily jobs, A/B testing when there are 3+ competing models.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   After the third use case (around month 4-5), patterns become obvious and a natural abstraction emerges.

11. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Heuristics
   The first model should be in production after 6 weeks, the second after another 8 weeks (showing a 25% reduction in time due to reuse), and the third after 6 weeks (50% reduction).
