----------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAIMS (sorted by confidence, descending)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.90 | Basis: Facts
   The Thesis has adapted by moderating its claims (from 40% to 32% cost reduction, from 15-point to 8-12 point CSAT improvement) and providing more detailed budget breakdowns ($180K, $200K, $120K for each phase).

2. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.80 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Antithesis maintains rigorous scrutiny, now focusing on the "long tail" problem of seemingly simple queries that contain hidden complexity, and questioning the eight-week timeline for 45% automation.

3. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The strategic framing has shifted from "replacement" to "intelligence amplification," directly addressing the Antithesis's concerns about human capital risks.

4. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Both parties have converged on the phased approach and the value of AI-human collaboration, but continue to diverge on execution feasibility and timeline realism.

5. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   Both sides now agree on phased implementation, intelligence amplification over replacement, and the three-tier architecture.

6. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Thesis has responded to previous critiques with concrete budget allocations and more realistic projections.

7. [HIGH] Confidence: 0.70 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Antithesis provides sophisticated critique about the "long tail" problem in automation.

8. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   The Antithesis's response appears incomplete, suggesting the debate was cut off mid-argument.

9. [MED]  Confidence: 0.60 | Basis: Reasoning
   Key implementation details are emerging, but critical gaps remain around change management specifics, fallback strategies, and detailed risk mitigation.

10. [MED]  Confidence: 0.50 | Basis: Reasoning
   The debate would benefit from one more complete round to fully address the timeline feasibility concerns and the "long tail" automation challenge raised by the Antithesis.
