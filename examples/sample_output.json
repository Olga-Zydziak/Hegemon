Phase 1 (Month 1): Deploy single high-ROI model with minimal infrastructure (Airflow, MLflow, FastAPI).

Phase 3 (Month 4): Establish bounded contexts architecture with explicit contracts only after validating 5+ models in production. Expected: 70% reduction in deployment time, 15+ models by year-end, avoiding premature complexity while maintaining evolution capacity.",

    "risk_analysis": "KEY RISKS: (1) Timeline optimism (30% probability) - 4-week platform builds unrealistic for first implementation. Mitigation: Start with single use case, add 8-week buffer per phase, establish explicit go/no-go gates based on ROI metrics. If first model doesn't hit 5% improvement, pause and reassess before Phase 2. (2) Technology complexity debt (40% probability) - Kubeflow/Seldon learning curve steep for 2-person ML team. Mitigation: Begin with simple tools (cron jobs, FastAPI), upgrade only after proving value with 3+ models. Keep escape hatches for direct deployment. Budget $20k for external consultants. (3) Feature store becoming bottleneck (25% probability) - Over-engineering feature store before validating reuse patterns. Mitigation: Implement feature store only for proven high-reuse features (>40% model usage), maintain direct data access as fallback. Monitor feature request latency (<50ms p95). (4) Team skill gaps (35% probability) - Existing team lacks MLOps expertise. Mitigation: Allocate 20% time for training (Coursera/Udemy courses), bring 1 senior MLOps consultant for first 2 months ($40k budget), create internal knowledge base with runbooks. (5) Vendor lock-in risk (20% probability) - Heavy reliance on AWS-specific services. Mitigation: Use open-source alternatives where possible (Feast vs SageMaker Feature Store), abstract cloud-specific APIs, maintain infrastructure-as-code for portability. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS: (1) First model MUST show measurable business impact ($100k+ annual value) within Month 2 - this validates entire approach. (2) Time-to-production for 2nd/3rd models should be <50% of first model - proves reusable patterns work. (3) Keep technical debt low by resisting premature abstractions - only generalize after 3+ examples of same pattern. (4) Maintain team velocity - if sprint velocity drops >20%, it signals over-complexity."
